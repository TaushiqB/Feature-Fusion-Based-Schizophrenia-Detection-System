things to say:

Introduction:
- Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting thinking, emotion, and behavior.
- Diagnosis based on patient behavior.
- Lack of objective diagnostic criteria and laboratory indicators.
- Provides effective methods for the classification of schizophrenia.
- Utilization of VGG16(visual geometry group) for extracting effective information from fMRI data.
- public data set of the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)
- contains 200 samples between the ages of 18
and 65.

Methodology:
- The VGG16 network consists of 5 convolution modules, 3 fully connected layers, an input layer, and an output layer.
- Each convolution module includes convolutional layers and downsampling layers using max pooling.
- Convolutional layers use 3×3 convolution kernels with a step size of 1, and pooling layers use a 2×2 max pool.
- Three fully connected layers follow the convolution modules.
- The network employs the ReLU activation function and softmax layer for classification.
- Retains the feature extraction layer of VGG16.
- Redesigns the classification layer to a 2-layer fully connected layer for the schizophrenia classification problem.
- Uses ReLU activation, dropout layer for preventing overfitting, and changes the output classification to two categories.
- Utilizes a pretrained VGG16 model on the ImageNet dataset.
- retains the feature extraction layer and retrains the classification layer for the schizophrenia classification model.
- This methodology provides an overview of the VGG16 network, its limitations, improvements, and the application of transfer learning for the specific task of schizophrenia classification.
